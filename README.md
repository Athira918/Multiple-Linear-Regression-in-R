# Multiple-Linear-Regression-in-R
Multiple Linear Regression in R
This script demonstrates the structure for building a Multiple Linear Regression model in R. The process includes:

Importing and preprocessing the dataset

Encoding categorical variables as factors

Splitting the dataset into training and test sets

Training the regression model using the lm() function

Making predictions on the test set

Visualizing the comparison between actual and predicted values using ggplot2

The visualization helps assess how closely the predicted values align with the actual values, providing insight into the modelâ€™s performance.
